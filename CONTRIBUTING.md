## Introduction

To contribute, whether adding / modifying an endpoint or working on the tooling,
start by making a branch. (As we build out the full tooling in the roadmap,
everything will key off of the branch name, although that is not currently
relevant.)

`git checkout -b <name_of_branch>`

If you are adding or modifying endpoints, keep your work in the branch until the
feature is shipped in `lob-api`. Before the feature ships, you can generate a
[mock server](MOCKING.md) to assist in development.

This project uses CI/CD; as you push your branch to github, github actions will run tests and, if
those tests pass, build release artifacts (bundled spec, postman collection, ...) and push them
to your branch on github under the `dist/` directory. Because the CI/CD cycle on github pushes
additional commits to your branch, you will either need to pull those commits or force push (`git push -f`)
when pushing additional work to the branch. Don't be afraid to force push: the actions build each
artifact anew on each push.

## Documentation Style

The generated docs are in html, but the documentation is written in the `yml` files. In order to add things like lists, code highlighting, or hyperlinks, you need to use the markdown style of [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/).

## Adding a Form Factor (aka Resource)

### Generating a Resource Skeleton

You can use the [Lob OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/lob/generator-lob-openapi) to create the basic file structure needed to create a resource. The generator is built off of [Yeoman's](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) generator. This is how to set up the Lob OpenAPI generator the first time you use it:

1. `cd` out of your `lob-openapi` directory and run `git clone git@github.com:lob/generator-lob-openapi.git`.
2. Enter the generator repo: `cd generator-lob-openapi`.
3. Run `npm link` (you may see an error telling you that you are missing `husky` or another dependency; in which case, run `npm install`)
4. Go back to your OpenAPI repo: `cd /path/to/lob-openapi`
5. Run `npm link generator-lob-openapi`, which will connect the generator to OpenAPI locally
6. Run `yo lob-openapi:resource <resource_name>` and fill in the subsequent prompts with the pertinent information.

Below is an example of what running the `yo` command will produce when creating a sample resource, checks:

```bash
$ yo lob-openapi:resource checks
? Resource path? /checks
? Prefix in id? <enter for none> chk
   create shared/attributes/model_ids/chk_id.yml
   create resources/checks/models/check_editable.yml
   create resources/checks/models/check_updatable.yml
   create resources/checks/models/check.yml
   create resources/checks/responses/check.yml
   create resources/checks/responses/all_checks.yml
   create resources/checks/checks.yml
   create resources/checks/check.yml
   create tests/checks_test.js
checks scaffolded. Add paths to your spec file.
You will need to review the files added and customize them to your endpoint as needed.
```

### Resource IDs

These are unique identifiers which are associated with specific resources, such as letters or addresses. As shown in the previous section, resource IDs contain a prefix, which should be specified in [the docs](https://docs.lob.com/) under the relevant header. Resource IDs are stored as shared attributes, since they can be used in multiple places; there is a `model_ids` folder within `shared/attributes`. Here is an example of how a resource ID pattern is structured for postcard:

`pattern: "^psc_[a-zA-Z0-9]+$"`

### Resource Structure

Many resources have CREATE, RETRIEVE, DELETE/cancel, LIST, and/or UPDATE properties. Start by writing out create, then work on list/retrieve/update, and finish with list/cancel. For this section we will use the [Check resource documentation](https://docs.lob.com/#checks) as a reference.

The object described at the very beginning of the Checks section in the docs is what you will be returning (in the retrieve endpoint). Compare this to the check creation payload parameters so that you can find the commonalities between the two sets of properties. Then turn those commonalities into a `check_base.yml` file. For example, both the returned object and the creation parameters contain `to` and `from` fields, so they would be placed in `resources/checks/models/check_base.yml`.

The next step is to create `resources/checks/models/check_editable.yml`, which will contain all the properties unique to the check creation payload parameters list. Use the structure

```yaml
allOf:
  - $ref: "check_base.yml"
```

at the very top of the `check_editable.yml` file in order to import all the common properties you had previously extrapolated into the base file.

Repeat this process for `resources/checks/models/check.yml`, which will contain all the fields described only in the [check object at the top of the docs section](https://docs.lob.com/#checks_object).

Then navigate to the top-level `resources/checks/checks.yml`. It might initially seem confusing that there are both `check.yml` and `checks.yml` in the same place. `checks/checks.yml` should contain a `GET` and a `POST`––the `GET` is for retrieving a list of postcards, and the `POST` is for check creation. This latter part is what you should fill out first. For an example of how the creation `POST` request spec should look, check out `resources/checks/models/postcards.yml`.

LIST, RETRIEVE, and DELETE will follow similar patterns for most resources, so check out how they're organised in `resources/checks/models/postcards.yml` and `resources/checks/models/postcard.yml` in order to proceed with this.

In between adding to your resource, you should run `spectral lint Lob-API-public.yml` quite frequently. That way, you can catch linting errors easily rather than wasting an entire day poking around the code to hunt down a persistent error before discovering that it was an indentation issue (no, I'm not bitter or anything, why do you ask?).

## Adding a new Route

Sometimes you only need to add a new route to an existing resource. You will need to create a new file in the appropriate folder in `resources/`.

The response to that route will go into that resources `responses/` folder.

You then want to make sure that you add the new path in `Lob-API-public.yml` that will reference your new file, making sure that more specific paths happen first in the order they are listed.

You can add the tests for your route to the existing test file for the resource, or create a separate test file for your route. The choice is up to you. Some factors
to take into consideration include the length and complexity of the existing test file and your new tests and how much of the code in existing test you might
be able to reuse. _If you do put your test in a separate file, make sure you modify the entry for your resource in `config: goalie-mappings` in `package.json` so that your tests get run during CI and monitoring!_

## Contract Testing

We test our API contracts using the [Prism client](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/prism/docs/guides/http-client.md). We run the tests with [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/main/docs/01-writing-tests.md). The contract tests run on github whenever you push to github and/or open a pull request.

To run the existing tests locally:

- Navigate to your [Dashboard settings](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/login?redirect=1) and grab both secret keys.
- add the tokens to your environment by including `export LOB_API_LIVE_TOKEN="<live token>"` and `export LOB_API_TEST_TOKEN="<test token>"`
  to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` (if you're using a z-shell).
- run `source ~/.bash_profile` (or `source ~/.zshrc`).
- run `npm test`.

### Running a Single Test with `.only`

To run a single test, use `.only` as usual.

### Adding a Test

To add a test, look in the `tests/` directory for a file named for the resource with
the endpoint in question. If you used the generator, the test file should already be present within `tests/`.

#### Local File Inputs

If you're using any local file inputs within your tests, place them in the `tests/assets/` folder. This is how I read from a local file within `postcards_test.js`:

```js
function streamToString(stream) {
  const chunks = [];
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    stream.on("data", (chunk) => chunks.push(Buffer.from(chunk)));
    stream.on("error", (err) => reject(err));
    stream.on("end", () => resolve(Buffer.concat(chunks).toString("utf8")));
  });
}

const files = fs.createReadStream(
  path.resolve(
    "tests/assets/customer-thank-you-postcard-template-4x6-front.html"
  )
);
const frontBack = await streamToString(files);
```

### Notes about Test Design

There is one stand-out quirks with the tests. Notice the

```
"content-type": "application/json; charset=utf-8",
```

statement in `tests/setup.js`. This is there because, as discovered during the writing of the `us_autocompletions` test file, the content-type header isn't always applied by default to the request, so it has to be manually added in during the setup (all the endpoints authored out here accept JSON).

## Debugging: Prism as a Validation Proxy

We have found it useful to can run Prism as a [validation proxy](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/prism/docs/getting-started/03-cli.md#proxy). To do so, run `npm run proxy`.

```bash
$ npm run proxy
[1:20:53 PM] › [CLI] …  awaiting  Starting Prism…
[1:20:53 PM] › [CLI] ℹ  info      GET        http://127.0.0.1:4010/addresses/adr_D9V2vWn
[1:20:53 PM] › [CLI] ℹ  info      GET        http://127.0.0.1:4010/addresses?Limit=55
[1:20:53 PM] › [CLI] ▶  start     Prism is listening on http://127.0.0.1:4010
```

Once Prism is listening, you can issue http requests to the proxy port, in this
case `http://127.0.0.1:4010` using the client of your choice. The example below uses
[httpie](https://httpie.io/docs#main-features), a user friendly client.

Anatomy of the HTTPie request:

- `-a <YOUR API key>`: used for authentication. You can retrieve your API keys (live & test) from [your dashboard](http://dashboard.lob.com/).
- `-v`: verbose output, which includes detail like intermediate requests & responses taking place during this call
- `GET`: the type of request (in this example, we are retrieving a single address given an ID)
- `127.0.0.1:4010`: the address and port on which Prism is listening (see the `proxy` script in `package.json` for exact details)
- `addresses`: the Lob API endpoint we're hitting
- `ADR ID`: the ID of the address we want to retrieve.
- `Accept-Encoding: `: Leaving this blank overrides the default setting. Otherwise, if this part is left out, the following error will be thrown: `ContentDecodingError: 'Received response with content-encoding: gzip, but failed to decode it.'`

```bash
$ http -a <YOUR API KEY>: -v GET http://127.0.0.1:4010/addresses/<ADR ID> Accept-Encoding:

GET /addresses/adr_fa85158b26c3eb7c HTTP/1.1

}
```

The `Accept-Encoding:` header included in the request unsets `httpie`'s default
header `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate`.

Any contract violations will be returned in a `s1-violations` header, which will
contain a JSON object with all violations found in the response. You can also
use the `--errors` flag which will turn any request or response violation found
into a [RFC7807](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) machine readable error.

## Development: Mock Server

You can also run Prism as a mock server using the spec for new endpoints.
Mocking is discussed in depth in a separate [guide](MOCKING.md).
