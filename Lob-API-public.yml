  - name: Addresses
    description: |
      To add an address to your address book, you create a new address object. You can retrieve and delete individual
      addresses as well as get a list of addresses. Addresses are identified by a unique random ID.

  - name: API Keys
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      Lob authenticates your API requests using your account's API keys.
      If you do not include your key when making an API request, or use
      one that is incorrect or outdated, Lob returns an error with a `401`
      HTTP response code. You can find all API keys in your dashboard
      under [Settings](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/keys).

      There are two types of API keys: *secret* and *publishable*.

      - **Secret API keys** should be kept confidential and only stored on your own servers.
      Your account's secret API key can perform any API request to Lob without restriction.

      - **Publishable API keys** are limited to US verifications, international verifications,
      and US autocomplete requests. While we encourage you to use a secret key for maximum
      security, you can publish these keys to JavaScript code or in an Android or iPhone app
      without exposing print and mail services or your secret key. Publishable keys are always
      prefixed with `[environment]_pub`.

      Every type comes with a pair of keys: one for the testing environment and one for the
      live environment. We recommend reading [Test and Live Environments](#tag/Test-and-Live-Environments)
      for more information.

  - name: Asset URLs
    x-traitTag: true
    description: >-
      All asset URLs returned by the Lob API (postcards, letters, thumbnails,
      etc) are signed links served over HTTPS. All links returned will expire in
      30 days to prevent mis-sharing. Each time a GET request is initiated, a
      new signed URL will be generated.

  - name: Authentication
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |

      Requests made to the API are protected with [HTTP Basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      In order to properly authenticate with the API you must use your API key as the username
      while leaving the password blank. Requests not properly authenticated will return a `401`
      [error code](#tag/Errors). You can find your account's API keys
      in your [Dashboard Settings](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/keys).

      <h3>Example Request</h3>

      curl uses the -u flag to pass basic auth credentials (adding a colon after your API key will prevent it from asking you for a
      password). One of our test API keys has been filled into all the examples on the page, so you can test out any example right away.


      ```bash
      curl https://api.lob.com/v1/addresses \
        -u test_0dc8d51e0acffcb1880e0f19c79b2f5b0cc:
      ```

  - name: Bank Accounts
    description: |
      Bank Accounts allow you to store your bank account securely in our system. The API provides
      endpoints for creating bank accounts, deleting bank accounts, verifying bank accounts,
      retrieving individual bank accounts, and retrieving a list of bank accounts.

  - name: Beta Program
    description: |
      Here at Lob, we pride ourselves on building high quality platform capabilities rapidly
      and iteratively, so we can constantly be delivering additional value to our customers.
      When evaluating a new product or feature from Lob, you may see that it has been released in Beta.

      Typically, something in Beta means that the feature is early in its lifecycle here at
      Lob. While we fully stand behind the quality of everything we release in Beta, we do
      anticipate receiving a higher level of customer feedback on Beta features, as well as a
      faster pace of changes from our engineering team in response to that feedback.

      By participating in a Lob Beta program, you will have the opportunity to get early access
      to a new product capability, as well as having a unique opportunity to influence the product's
      direction with your feedback.

      You should also anticipate that features in Beta may have functional or design limitations,
      and might change rapidly as we receive customer feedback and make improvements. In particular,
      new APIs in Beta may also go through more frequent versioning and version deprecation cycles
      than our more mature APIs.

      If you are participating in a Beta program and want to provide feedback, please feel free to
      [contact us](https://lob.com/support#contact)!

  - name: Billing Groups
    description: |
      Billing groups allow you to create and view labels that can be attached to certain consumption-based
      usages of Letters, Checks, Postcards and Self-Mailers to customize your bill. Please check each
      resource API section to learn more about how to attach billing groups in the API.

  - name: Bulk Intl Verifications
    description: Verify a list of non-US addresses.

  - name: Bulk US Verifications
    description: Verify a list of US addresses.

  - name: Cancellation Windows
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      By default, all new accounts have a 5 minute cancellation window for postcards,
      self mailers, letters, and checks. Within that timeframe, you can cancel
      mailings from production, free of charge. Once the window has passed for a
      postcard, self mailer, letter, or check, the mailing is no longer cancelable.
      In addition, certain customers can customize their cancellation windows by
      product in their [Dashboard Settings](https://dashboard.lob.com/#). Upgrade to
      the appropriate [Print & Mail Edition](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/editions)
      to automatically gain access to this ability. For more details on this feature,
      check out our [Cancellation Guide](https://lob.com/guides#cancellation_windows).

      If you schedule a postcard, self mailer, letter, or check for up to 180 days
      in the future by supplying the `send_date` parameter, that will override any
      cancellation window you may have for that product.

      To get started you'll create an account at [Lob.com](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/register) to obtain some API Keys.
      The keys are available in the dashboard [settings](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/keys) and use the format, `test_*.`
      for your Test API key and `live_*.` for your Live API key.

    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      Use a pre-designed template from our [gallery](https://lob.com/resources/template-gallery) or follow these
      basic [guidelines](https://github.com/lob/examples) as starting points for creating custom Postcards,
      Self Mailers, Letters, and Checks.

      Please follow the standards used in these templates, such as:
      - For any linked assets, you must use a performant file hosting provider with no rate limits such as Amazon
      S3.
      - Use inline styles or an internal stylesheet, do not link to external stylesheets.
      - Link to images that are 300DPI and sized at the final desired size on the physical mailing. For example,
      for a photo that is desired to be 1in x 1in on the final postcard, the image asset should be sized at 1in
      x 1in at 300DPI (which equates to 300px by 300px).
      - The sum of all linked assets should not exceed 5MB in file size.
      - Use `-webkit` prefixes for CSS properties when recommended [here](http://shouldiprefix.com/).

      Because different browsers have varying user-agent styles, the HTML you see in your browser will not
      always look identical to what is produced through the API. It is **strongly** recommended that you test all
      HTML requests by reviewing the final PDF files in your Test Environment, as these are the files that will be
      printed.

  - name: HTML Templates
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      You can save commonly used HTML as templates within Lob to more easily manage them. You can reference
      your saved templates in postcard, letter, and check requests instead of having to pass a long HTML
      string on each request. Additionally, you can make changes to your HTML templates and update them
      independently, without having to touch your API integration. Templates can be created, edited,
      and viewed on your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/templates). To use a template in a postcard,
      letter, or check, see the documentation for each endpoint below. For help using templates, check out our
      [HTML Templates Guide](https://lob.com/guides#html_templates) or get started with a
      [pre-designed template from our gallery](https://lob.com/template-gallery). In Live mode, you can only have
      as many templates as allotted in your current
      [Print & Mail Edition](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/editions). There is no limit in Test mode.

      If you'd like to interact with templates programmatically, check out our Beta Program for API access
      to the [HTML Templates Endpoints](#tag/Templates).

      <h3>Example Create Request using HTML Templates</h3>

      ```bash
        curl https://api.lob.com/v1/postcards \
          -u test_0dc8d51e0acffcb1880e0f19c79b2f5b0cc: \

  - name: Idempotent Requests
    x-traitTag: true
    description: >-
      Lob supports idempotency for safely retrying `POST` requests to create
      postcards, self mailers, letters, and checks without accidentally creating
      duplicates.


      For example, if a request to create a check fails due to a network error,
      you can safely retry the same request with the same idempotency key and
      guarantee that only one check will ultimately be created and sent. When a
      request is sent with an idempotency key for an already created resource,
      the response object for the existing resource will be returned.


      To perform an idempotent `POST` request to one of the mailpiece product
      endpoints, provide an additional `Idempotency-Key` header or an `idempotency_key`
      query parameter to the request. If multiple idempotency keys are provided,
      the request will fail. How you create unique keys is up to you, but we
      suggest using random values, such as V4 UUIDs. Idempotency keys are intended
      to prevent issues over a short periods of time, therefore keys expire after
      24 hours. Keys are unique by mode (Test vs. Live) as well as by resource
      (postcard vs. letter, etc.).


      By default, all `GET` and `DELETE` requests are idempotent by nature, so
      they do not require an additional idempotency key.


      For more help integrating idempotency keys, refer to our
      [implementation guide](https://lob.com/guides#idempotent_request).

      Currently we support the following file types for all endpoints:
      - PDF
      - PNG
      - JPEG

      **Templates**

      You can find pre-made templates that already adhere to all of these guidelines here:
      - [Postcards](#tag/Postcards)
      - [Letters](#tag/Letters)
      - [Checks](#tag/Checks)
      - [Self Mailers](#tag/Self-Mailers)

      **Prepping All Images**

      The following guidelines apply to image types:
      - Images should be 300 dpi or higher - PNG/JPEG files with less than 300 dpi will be rejected.
      - Your artwork should include a 1/8" border around the final trim size. This means your final file size will be a total of 0.25" larger than your expected printed piece (ie, a 4"x6" postcard should be submitted as 4.25"x6.25"). There is no need to include crop marks in your submitted content.
      - Include a safe zone – make sure no critical elements are within 1/8" from the edge of the final size.
      - Do not include any additional postage marks or indicia.
      - File sizes should be no larger than 5MB.

      **Prepping PDFs**

      To ensure that you are producing PDF's correctly please follow the guidelines below:
      - [Make sure all non-standard fonts are embedded.](#tag/Standard-PDF-Fonts)
      - Generated PDF's need to be be PDF/A compliant.

      **Prepping PNGs/JPEGs**

      To ensure that you are producing PNG's/JPEG's correctly please follow the guidelines below:

      - Minimum 300 dpi. The dpi is calculated as (width of image in pixels) / (width of product in inches) and (length of image in pixels) / (length of product in inches). For Example: 1275px x 1875px image used to create a 4.25" x 6.25" postcard has a dpi of 300.
      - Submitted images must have the same length to width ratio as the chosen product. Images will not be cropped or stretched by the API.

    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      When verifying international addresses, you'll likely want to test against
      a wide array of addresses to ensure you're handling responses correctly.
      With your test API key, requests that use specific values for `primary_line`
      let you explore the responses to many types of addresses:

      | DELIVERABILITY OF SAMPLE RESPONSE | SET `primary_line` TO    |
      |-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
      | `deliverable`                     | deliverable              |
      | `deliverable_missing_info`        | deliverable missing info |
      | `undeliverable`                   | undeliverable            |
      | `no_match`                        | no match                 |

      See the `test` request & response examples under [Intl Verification Examples](#operation/intl_verification) within the
      "Verify an international address section" in Intl Verifications.

      You can rely on the response from these examples generally matching the response
      you'd see in the live environment with an address of that type (excluding the `recipient` field).

      The test API key does not perform any verification, automatic correction, or standardization
      for addresses. If you wish to try these features out, use our [live demo](https://lob.com/address-verification)
      or the free plan (see [our pricing](https://lob.com/pricing/address-verification) for details).

      Lob’s Print & Mail and Address Verification APIs helps companies transform outdated,
      manual print & mail processes and save 1,000s of hours in processing time by sending mail much more
      quickly, and increasing ROI on offline communications.

      Automate direct mail by triggering on-demand postcards, letters, and checks directly from your
      CRM or customer data systems.

      Address Verification corrects, standardizes, and cleanses address data for assured delivery with
      instant verification across 240+ countries and territories.

      Lob's global print delivery network eliminates the hassle of vendor management with automated
      production and postage across a global network of vetted commercial printers.

      Tracking & Analytics give you complete visibility of production and delivery for each piece of
      mail you send to meet compliance requirements and measure campaign performance.

  - name: Letters
    description: |
      The letters endpoint allows you to easily print and mail letters. The API provides endpoints for
      creating letters, retrieving individual letters, canceling letters, and retrieving a list of letters.

  - name: Metadata
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      When creating any Lob object, you can include a metadata object with up to 20 key-value pairs of
      custom data. You can use metadata to store information like `metadata[customer_id] = "987654"` or
      `metadata[campaign] = "NEWYORK2015"`. This is especially useful for filtering and matching to internal
      systems.

      Each metadata key must be less than 40 characters long and values must be less than 500 characters.
      Metadata does not support nested objects.

  - name: NCOA
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      National Change of Address (NCOA) is a service offered by the USPS, which allows individuals
      or businesses who have recently moved to have any mail forwarded from their previous address
      to their new address. As a CASS-certified Address Verification Provider, Lob also offers NCOA
      functionality to our Print & Mail customers. With the Lob NCOA feature enabled, Postcards,
      Letters, Checks and Addresses can automatically be corrected to reflect an individual's or business's
      new address in the case that they have moved (only if they have registered for NCOA with the USPS).
      Due to privacy concerns and USPS constraints, for customers with NCOA enabled, our API responses
      for a limited set of endpoints differ slightly in the case when an address has been changed through NCOA.

      NOTE: This feature is exclusive to certain customers. Upgrade to the appropriate [Print & Mail Edition](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/editions) to gain access.

      For more information, see our [NCOA guide](https://lob.com/guides#national_change).

  - name: NCOA Live Environment
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      Though there are no changes to API requests, there are significant changes to our API responses, but
      only in the event that an address has been changed through NCOA. If an address has not been changed
      through NCOA, the response would be identical to our standard responses, except the addition of a
      `recipient_moved` field, which is `false` for unchanged addresses.

      If an address has been changed through NCOA, we are required to suppress the following response
      fields for that address:
      - `address_line1`
      - `address_line2`
      - The +4 portion of the ZIP+4 (5-digit ZIP code will still be present)

      See the `ncoa_us_live` example under [Responses](#operation/create_address) within the "Create an Address" section in Addresses
      (along with the corresponding request under "Requests").

  - name: NCOA Test Environment
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      In addition to sending live requests, you may also want to simulate what an NCOA response might
      look like so that you can ensure your application behaves as expected. The behavior of NCOA in
      Lob's Test Environment is very similar to our [US Verifications Test Mode](#tag/US-Verifications-Test-Environment).

      To simulate an NCOA request, send a POST request to any of the four endpoints below with an `address_line1` field equal to `NCOA`:
      - `POST /v1/addresses`
      - `POST /v1/checks`
      - `POST /v1/letters`
      - `POST /v1/postcards`
      - `POST /v1/self_mailers`

      A static address will always be returned, as documented in the `ncoa_us_test` example under [Responses](#operation/create_address) within the "Create an Address"
      section in Addresses (along with the corresponding request under "Requests").

  - name: Postcards
    description: |
      The postcards endpoint allows you to easily print and mail postcards. The API provides endpoints for creating postcards,
      retrieving individual postcards, canceling postcards, and retrieving a list of postcards.

  - name: Rate Limiting
    x-traitTag: true
    description: >-
      To prevent misuse, we enforce a rate limit on an API Key and endpoint basis,
      similar to the way many other APIs enforce rate limits. By default, all accounts
      and their corresponding Test and Live API Keys have a rate limit of 150 requests
      per 5 seconds per endpoint. The `POST /v1/us_verifications` and `POST /v1/us_autocompletions`
      endpoints have a limit of 300 requests per 5 seconds for all accounts.


      When your application exceeds the rate limit for a given API endpoint, the
      Lob API will return an HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" response code instead of
      the variety of codes you would find across the other API endpoints.


      **HTTP Headers**


      HTTP headers are returned on each request to a rate limited endpoint. Ensure
      that you inspect these headers during your requests as they provide relevant
      data on how many more requests your application is allowed to make for the
      endpoint you just utilized.


      While the headers are documented here in titlecase, HTTP headers are case
      insensitive and certain libraries may transform them to lowercase. Please
      inspect your headers carefully to see how they will be represented in your
      chosen development scenario.

          <tr>
            <td>X-Rate-Limit-Limit:</td>

      ```


      <h3>Example Response</h3>


      If you hit the rate limit on a given endpoint, this is the body of the HTTP
      429 message that you will see:


      ```javascript
        {
          "error": {
            "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please wait 5 seconds and try your request again.",
            "code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
            "status_code": 429
          }
        }
      ```

  - name: Request Bodies
    x-traitTag: true
    description: >-
      When manually sending a POST HTTP request directly to the Lob API, without
      the use of a library, you may represent the body as either a Form URL
      Encoded request, a JSON document, or a Multipart Form Data request.


      However, if you're using one of our [SDKs](#tag/SDKs-and-Tools),
      the generation of the request bodies is done for you automatically and you don't
      need to worry about the format.


      <h3>Form URL Encoded</h3>


      This request body encoding is accompanied with the
      `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header. The content is an
      example of what the [Verify a US address](index.html#operation/us_verification)
      endpoint accepts. An example of a request body encoded in this format follows.


      ```javascript
        primary_line=185 Berry Street&city=San Francisco&state=CA&zip_code=94107
      ```


      <h3>JSON</h3>


      This request body encoding is accompanied with the `Content-Type: application/json` header.
      The content is an example of what the [Verify a US address endpoint](index.html#operation/us_verification)
      accepts. An example of a request body encoded in this format follows.


      ```javascript
        {
          "primary_line": "185 Berry Street",
          "city": "San Francisco",
          "state": "CA",
          "zip_code": "94107"
        }
      ```


      <h3>Multipart Form Data</h3>


      This request body encoding is accompanied with the `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`
      header. This is the only format that can be used for uploading a file to the API. The
      content is an example of what the [Create a check](index.html#operation/create_check)
      endpoint accepts. An example of a request body encoded in this format follows.


      ```javascript
        --------------------------7015ebe79c0a5f8c

  - name: Standard PDF Fonts
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      Ideally, all fonts in provided PDFs should be embedded. Embedding a font in a PDF ensures that the final
      printed product will look as it was designed. Fonts can vary greatly in size and shape, even within the
      same family. If the exact font that was used to design the artwork is not used to print, the look and
      placement of the text is not guaranteed to be the same.

      In general, requests that provide PDFs with un-embedded fonts will be rejected. We make an exception for
      "standard fonts", a set of fonts that we have identified as being common. PDFs that contain un-embedded
      fonts that are found in the list, and match the accepted [font type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Font_formats)
      will be accepted. Otherwise, the request will be rejected.

      Font embedding is an essential part of standard PDF workflows. Fonts should be embedded automatically by
      PDF editing software that are compliant with PDF standards.

    description: >-
      To make the API as explorable as possible, accounts have test and live
      environment API keys. You're not charged any fees in the test environment,
      so we encourage you to use it to try out services, perform quality
      assurance, and run automated testing. Objects―addresses, letters, checks,
      etc―in one environment cannot be manipulated by objects in the other.
      In general, a payment method (either credit card or ACH account) must be
      added to your account to make live API requests. However, a payment method
      is not required for the first 300 live requests per month to the
      `/v1/us_verifications` endpoint. After the first 300 requests, you will
      begin receiving errors with status code `403`.
      Requests made in the test environment always validate request arguments,
      simulate live environment behavior, and enforce rate limits. _They never
      print, mail nor, for verification services, verify addresses._ The US &
      International verification services trigger behavior with specific
      argument values, and, if you plan on using those, we recommend reading US
      Verification Test Environment and Intl Verification Test Environment.
      To switch between environments, use the appropriate key for that
      environment when performing a request. You can find each environment's API
      key in your dashboard under Settings; test API keys are always prefixed
      with `test_` and production API keys with `live_`.

  - name: US Autocompletions Test Environment
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      Your test API key does not autocomplete US addresses and is used to simulate
      behavior. With your test API key, requests with specific values for `address_prefix`
      return predetermined values. When `address_prefix` is set to:

      - `0 suggestions` - Returns no suggestions
      - `[PRIMARY NUMBER] s[uggestion]` - Returns a maximum of ten predefined suggested addresses.
        `[PRIMARY NUMBER]` does not have to be a valid primary number when sending a test request.
        Each additional letter in `suggestion` reduces the number of suggestions by one (e.g.
        `1 su` returns 9 suggested addresses). `[PRIMARY NUMBER]` does not affect the number of
        suggestions returned.

      City and state filters work as expected and filter the list of predetermined suggested addresses.

      See the `test` request & response examples under [Autocomplete Examples](#operation/autocompletion) within the "Autocomplete
      a partial address" section in US Autocompletions.

      When verifying US addresses, you'll likely want to test against a wide array of addresses to
      ensure you're handling responses correctly. With your test API key, requests that use specific
      values for `address` or `primary_line` and (if using `primary_line`) an arbitrary five digit
      number for `zip_code` (e.g. "11111") let you explore the responses to many types of addresses:

      | ADDRESS TYPE FOR SAMPLE RESPONSE                         | deliverability               | SET `primary_line` OR `address` TO |

      | Residential highrise                                     | deliverable                  | `residential highrise`             |
      | Residential house                                        | deliverable                  | `residential house`                |
      | PO Box                                                   | deliverable                  | `po box`                           |
      | Rural route                                              | deliverable                  | `rural route`                      |
      | Puerty Rico address w/ urbanization                      | deliverable                  | `puerto rico`                      |
      | Military address                                         | deliverable                  | `military`                         |

      | Missing a suite number                                   | deliverable_missing_unit     | `missing unit`                     |

      | Undeliverable and no block matched                       | undeliverable                | `undeliverable no match`           |

      See the `test` request & response examples under [US Verification Examples](#operation/us_verification) within the
      "Verify a US or US territory address" section in US Verifications.

      You can rely on the response from these examples generally matching the response you'd see in the live environment with an
      address of that type (excluding the `recipient` field).

      The test API key does not perform any verification, automatic correction, or standardization for addresses. If you wish to
      try these features out, use our [live demo](https://lob.com/address-verification) or the free plan (see [our pricing](https://lob.com/pricing/address-verification) for details).

      When backwards-incompatible changes are made to the API, a new dated version
      is released. The latest version of the API is version **2020-02-11**. You can
      view your version and upgrade to the latest version in your
      [Dashboard Settings](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/keys). You will
      only need to specify a version if you would like to test a newer version of
      the API without doing a full upgrade. The API will return an error if a
      version older than your current one is passed in. See
      [API Changelog](#tag/Changelog) for a full list of breaking changes.

  - name: Webhooks
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      Webhooks are an easy way to get notifications on events happening asynchronously
      within Lob's architecture. For example, when a postcard gets a "Processed For
      Delivery" tracking event, an event object of type `postcard.processed_for_delivery`
      will be created. If you are subscribed to that event type in that Environment
      (Test vs. Live), Lob will send that event to any URLs you've specified via an
      HTTP POST request. In Live mode, you can only have as many webhooks as allotted
      in your current [Print & Mail Edition](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/editions).
      There is no limit in Test mode.

      You can view and create [webhooks](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/webhooks) on the
      Lob Dashboard, as well as view your [events](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/events).
      See our [Webhooks Integration Guide](https://lob.com/guides#webhooks_block) for more
      details on how to integrate. Please see the full list of event types available for
      subscription here.
