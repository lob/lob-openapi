# hackathon-spec-v1

Working in this repo until we get the first endpoint or two in place.

## What's here and how to work with it


* I found a Redoc preview VS Code extension! It also provides linting that 
  complements Spectral. Please install `42crunch.vscode-openapi` and uninstall
  any of the previous preview extensions you may have had installed. To preview
  the docs (and a great way to QA PRs), open `Lob-API-public.yml` and click on
  the preview icon.

* If you have the stoplight spectral extension installed (v0.2.4), it will run
  as you type. I find it useful to install it as a CLI as well, as the VS Code
  plugin can get confused.
  
* I am finding that the linting by vscode-openapi catches some things that 
  Spectral misses and vice-versa.
