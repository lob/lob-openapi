                  Possible values are:

                  * `deliverable` – The address is deliverable by the USPS.

                  * `deliverable_unnecessary_unit` – The address is deliverable,
                  but the secondary unit information is unnecessary.

                  * `deliverable_incorrect_unit` – The address is deliverable to
                  the building's default address but the secondary unit provided
                  may not exist. There is a chance the mail will not reach the
                  intended recipient.

                  * `deliverable_missing_unit` – The address is deliverable to
                  the building's default address but is missing secondary unit
                  information. There is a chance the mail will not reach the
                  intended recipient.

                  * `undeliverable` – The address is not deliverable according
                  to the USPS.
