      All asset URLs returned by the Lob API (postcards, letters, thumbnails,
      etc) are signed links served over HTTPS. All links returned will expire in
      30 days to prevent mis-sharing. Each time a GET request is initiated, a
      new signed URL will be generated.

  - name: Test and Live Environments
    x-traitTag: true
    description: >-
      To make the API as explorable as possible, accounts have test and live
      environment API keys. You're not charged any fees in the test environment,
      so we encourage you to use it to try out services, perform quality
      assurance, and run automated testing. Objects―addresses, letters, checks,
      etc―in one environment cannot be manipulated by objects in the other. In
      general, a payment method (either credit card or ACH account) must be
      added to your account to make live API requests. However, a payment method
      is not required for the first 300 live requests per month to the
      `/v1/us_verifications` endpoint. After the first 300 requests, you will
      begin receiving errors with status code `403`. Requests made in the test
      environment always validate request arguments, simulate live environment
      behavior, and enforce rate limits. _They never print, mail nor, for
      verification services, verify addresses._ The US & International
      verification services trigger behavior with specific argument values, and,
      if you plan on using those, we recommend reading US Verification Test
      Environment and Int'l Verification Test Environment. To switch between
      environments, use the appropriate key for that environment when performing
      a request. You can find each environment's API key in your dashboard under
      Settings; test API keys are always prefixed with `test_` and production
      API keys with `live_`.

        You can input a merge variable payload object to your template to render
        dynamic content. For example, if you have a template like:
        `{{variable_name}}`, pass in `{"variable_name": "Harry"}` to render
        `Harry`. `merge_variables` must be an object. Any type of value is
        accepted as long as the object is valid JSON; you can use `strings`,
        `numbers`, `booleans`, `arrays`, `objects`, or `null`. The max length of
        the object is 25,000 characters. If you call `JSON.stringify` on your
        object, it can be no longer than 25,000 characters. Your variable names
        cannot contain any whitespace or any of the following special
        characters: `!`, `"`, `#`, `%`, `&`, `'`, `(`, `)`, `*`, `+`, `,`, `/`,
        `;`, `<`, `=`, `>`, `@`, `[`, `\`, `]`, `^`, ```, `{`, `|`, `}`, `~`.
        More instructions can be found in [our guide to using html and merge
        variables](https://lob.com/resources/guides/general/using-html-and-merge-variables).
        Depending on your [Merge Variable
        strictness](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/account) setting, if
        you define variables in your HTML but do not pass them here, you will
        either receive an error or the variable will render as an empty string.

        A timestamp in ISO 8601 format which specifies a date after the current
        time and up to 180 days in the future to send the letter off for
        production. Setting a send date overrides the default [cancellation
        window](https://docs.lob.com/#cancellation) applied to the mailpiece.
        Until the `send_date` has passed, the mailpiece can be canceled. If a
        date in the format `2017-11-01` is passed, it will evaluate to midnight
        UTC of that date (`2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z`). If a datetime is passed,
        that exact time will be used. A `send_date` passed with no time zone
        will default to UTC, while a `send_date` passed with a time zone will be
        converted to UTC.

                saved HTML template, or a remote URL or a local upload of an
                HTML or PDF file. Remote URLs have a 20 MB file size limit and
                must be downloaded within 40 seconds. HTML files passed as
                remote URLs or local file upload have no character limit. HTML
                merge variables should not include delimiting whitespace. All
                pages of a supplied PDF file must be sized at 8.5"x11", while
                supplied HTML will be rendered and trimmed to as many 8.5"x11"
                pages as necessary. For design specifications, please see our

                For domestic destinations, the file limit is 60 pages
                single-sided or 120 pages double-sided. For international
                destinations, the file limit is 6 pages single-sided or 12 pages
                double-sided. PDFs that surpass the file limit will error, while
                HTML that renders more pages than the file limit will be
                trimmed. See
                [pricing](https://lob.com/pricing/print-mail#compare) for extra
                costs incurred. Any letters over 6 pages single-sided or 12
                pages double-sided will be placed in a [flat
                envelope](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public.lob.com/assets/templates/letter_flat_template.pdf)
                instead of the standard double window envelope.

                  Possible values are:

                  * `deliverable` – The address is deliverable by the USPS.

                  * `deliverable_unnecessary_unit` – The address is deliverable,
                  but the secondary unit information is unnecessary.

                  * `deliverable_incorrect_unit` – The address is deliverable to
                  the building's default address but the secondary unit provided
                  may not exist. There is a chance the mail will not reach the
                  intended recipient.

                  * `deliverable_missing_unit` – The address is deliverable to
                  the building's default address but is missing secondary unit
                  information. There is a chance the mail will not reach the
                  intended recipient.

                  * `undeliverable` – The address is not deliverable according
                  to the USPS.

            in your HTML that is not passed in the `merge_variables` field of
            that request. Pass `''` or `null` to have a particular defined
            variable not render.

            in your HTML that is not included in the `merge_variables` field of
            that request. Instead, we will simply render nothing in the HTML in
            place of that merge variable.
