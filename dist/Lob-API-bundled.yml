      Lob authenticates your API requests using your account's API keys.

      If you do not include your key when making an API request, or use

      one that is incorrect or outdated, Lob returns an error with a `401`

      HTTP response code. You can find all API keys in your dashboard under
      Settings.


      There are two types of API keys: *secret* and *publishable*.


      - **Secret API keys** should be kept confidential and only stored on your
      own servers.

      Your account's secret API key can perform any API request to Lob without
      restriction.


      - **Publishable API keys** are limited to US verifications, international
      verifications,

      and US autocomplete requests. While we encourage you to use a secret key
      for maximum

      security, you can publish these keys to JavaScript code or in an Android
      or iPhone app

      without exposing print and mail services or your secret key. Publishable
      keys are always

      prefixed with `[environment]_pub`.


      Every type comes with a pair of keys: one for the testing environment and
      one for the

      live environment. We recommend reading Test and Live Environments for more
      information.
  - name: Asset URLs
    x-traitTag: true
    description: >-
      All asset URLs returned by the Lob API (postcards, letters, thumbnails,
      etc) are signed links served over HTTPS. All links returned will expire in
      30 days to prevent mis-sharing. Each time a GET request is initiated, a
      new signed URL will be generated.

  - name: Beta Program
    description: >
      Here at Lob, we pride ourselves on building high quality platform
      capabilities rapidly

      and iteratively, so we can constantly be delivering additional value to
      our customers.

      When evaluating a new product or feature from Lob, you may see that it has
      been released in Beta.


      Typically, something in Beta means that the feature is early in its
      lifecycle here at

      Lob. While we fully stand behind the quality of everything we release in
      Beta, we do

      anticipate receiving a higher level of customer feedback on Beta features,
      as well as a

      faster pace of changes from our engineering team in response to that
      feedback.


      By participating in a Lob Beta program, you will have the opportunity to
      get early access

      to a new product capability, as well as having a unique opportunity to
      influence the product's

      direction with your feedback.


      You should also anticipate that features in Beta may have functional or
      design limitations,

      and might change rapidly as we receive customer feedback and make
      improvements. In particular,

      new APIs in Beta may also go through more frequent versioning and version
      deprecation cycles

      than our more mature APIs.


      If you are participating in a Beta program and want to provide feedback,
      please feel free to

      [contact us](https://lob.com/support#contact)!

    x-traitTag: true

      By default, all new accounts have a 5 minute cancellation window for
      postcards,

      self mailers, letters, and checks. Within that timeframe, you can cancel

      mailings from production, free of charge. Once the window has passed for a

      postcard, self mailer, letter, or check, the mailing is no longer
      cancelable.

      In addition, certain customers can customize their cancellation windows by

      product in their [Dashboard Settings](https://dashboard.lob.com/#).
      Upgrade to

      the appropriate [Print & Mail
      Edition](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/editions)

      to automatically gain access to this ability. For more details on this
      feature,

      check out our [Cancellation
      Guide](https://lob.com/guides#cancellation_windows).


      If you schedule a postcard, self mailer, letter, or check for up to 180
      days

      in the future by supplying the `send_date` parameter, that will override
      any

      cancellation window you may have for that product.

    x-traitTag: true
    description: >-
      To make the API as explorable as possible, accounts have test and live
      environment API keys. You're not charged any fees in the test environment,
      so we encourage you to use it to try out services, perform quality
      assurance, and run automated testing. Objects―addresses, letters, checks,
      etc―in one environment cannot be manipulated by objects in the other. In
      general, a payment method (either credit card or ACH account) must be
      added to your account to make live API requests. However, a payment method
      is not required for the first 300 live requests per month to the
      `/v1/us_verifications` endpoint. After the first 300 requests, you will
      begin receiving errors with status code `403`. Requests made in the test
      environment always validate request arguments, simulate live environment
      behavior, and enforce rate limits. _They never print, mail nor, for
      verification services, verify addresses._ The US & International
      verification services trigger behavior with specific argument values, and,
      if you plan on using those, we recommend reading US Verification Test
      Environment and Intl Verification Test Environment. To switch between
      environments, use the appropriate key for that environment when performing
      a request. You can find each environment's API key in your dashboard under
      Settings; test API keys are always prefixed with `test_` and production
      API keys with `live_`.

  - name: Webhooks
    x-traitTag: true
    description: >
      Webhooks are an easy way to get notifications on events happening
      asynchronously

      within Lob's architecture. For example, when a postcard gets a "Processed
      For

      Delivery" tracking event, an event object of type
      `postcard.processed_for_delivery`

      will be created. If you are subscribed to that event type in that
      Environment

      (Test vs. Live), Lob will send that event to any URLs you've specified via
      an

      HTTP POST request. In Live mode, you can only have as many webhooks as
      allotted

      in your current [Print & Mail
      Edition](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/editions).

      There is no limit in Test mode.


      You can view and create [webhooks](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/webhooks)
      on the

      Lob Dashboard, as well as view your
      [events](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/events).

      See our [Webhooks Integration
      Guide](https://lob.com/guides#webhooks_block) for more

      details on how to integrate. Please see the full list of event types
      available for

                standarize user input, errors were introduced.

                completely.

                * LM3 - Missing Info. The input data cannot be corrected
                completely and there were multiple matches found in databases.

                * LM2 - Missing Info. The input data cannot be corrected
                completely and only some elements were found.

                * LU1 - Unverfied. The input data cannot be corrected or

        `Harry`. `merge_variables` must be an object. Any type of value is
        accepted as long as the object is valid JSON; you can use `strings`,
        `numbers`, `booleans`, `arrays`, `objects`, or `null`. The max length of
        the object is 25,000 characters. If you call `JSON.stringify` on your
        object, it can be no longer than 25,000 characters. Your variable names
        cannot contain any whitespace or any of the following special
        characters: `!`, `"`, `#`, `%`, `&`, `'`, `(`, `)`, `*`, `+`, `,`, `/`,

        Depending on your [Merge Variable
        strictness](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/account) setting, if
        you define variables in your HTML but do not pass them here, you will
        either receive an error or the variable will render as an empty string.

      description: >-
        A timestamp in ISO 8601 format which specifies a date after the current
        time and up to 180 days in the future to send the letter off for
        production. Setting a send date overrides the default [cancellation
        window](https://docs.lob.com/#cancellation) applied to the mailpiece.
        Until the `send_date` has passed, the mailpiece can be canceled. If a
        date in the format `2017-11-01` is passed, it will evaluate to midnight
        UTC of that date (`2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z`). If a datetime is passed,
        that exact time will be used. A `send_date` passed with no time zone
        will default to UTC, while a `send_date` passed with a time zone will be
        converted to UTC.
