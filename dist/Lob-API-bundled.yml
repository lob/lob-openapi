      All asset URLs returned by the Lob API (postcards, letters, thumbnails,

      30 days to prevent mis-sharing. Each time a GET request is initiated, a
      new signed URL will be generated.

    description: >-
      To make the API as explorable as possible, accounts have test and live
      environment API keys. You're not charged any fees in the test environment,
      so we encourage you to use it to try out services, perform quality
      assurance, and run automated testing. Objects―addresses, letters, checks,
      etc―in one environment cannot be manipulated by objects in the other. In
      general, a payment method (either credit card or ACH account) must be
      added to your account to make live API requests. However, a payment method
      is not required for the first 300 live requests per month to the
      `/v1/us_verifications` endpoint. After the first 300 requests, you will
      begin receiving errors with status code `403`. Requests made in the test
      environment always validate request arguments, simulate live environment
      behavior, and enforce rate limits. _They never print, mail nor, for
      verification services, verify addresses._ The US & International
      verification services trigger behavior with specific argument values, and,
      if you plan on using those, we recommend reading US Verification Test
      Environment and Int'l Verification Test Environment. To switch between
      environments, use the appropriate key for that environment when performing
      a request. You can find each environment's API key in your dashboard under
      Settings; test API keys are always prefixed with `test_` and production
      API keys with `live_`.

    merge_variables:
      type: object
      description: >-
        You can input a merge variable payload object to your template to render
        dynamic content. For example, if you have a template like:
        `{{variable_name}}`, pass in `{"variable_name": "Harry"}` to render
        `Harry`. `merge_variables` must be an object. Any type of value is
        accepted as long as the object is valid JSON; you can use `strings`,
        `numbers`, `booleans`, `arrays`, `objects`, or `null`. The max length of
        the object is 25,000 characters. If you call `JSON.stringify` on your
        object, it can be no longer than 25,000 characters. Your variable names
        cannot contain any whitespace or any of the following special
        characters: `!`, `"`, `#`, `%`, `&`, `'`, `(`, `)`, `*`, `+`, `,`, `/`,
        `;`, `<`, `=`, `>`, `@`, `[`, `\`, `]`, `^`, ```, `{`, `|`, `}`, `~`.
        More instructions can be found in [our guide to using html and merge
        variables](https://lob.com/resources/guides/general/using-html-and-merge-variables).
        Depending on your [Merge Variable
        strictness](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/account) setting, if
        you define variables in your HTML but do not pass them here, you will
        either receive an error or the variable will render as an empty string.

    send_date:

      description: >-
        A timestamp in ISO 8601 format which specifies a date after the current
        time and up to 180 days in the future to send the letter off for
        production. Setting a send date overrides the default [cancellation
        window](https://docs.lob.com/#cancellation) applied to the mailpiece.
        Until the `send_date` has passed, the mailpiece can be canceled. If a
        date in the format `2017-11-01` is passed, it will evaluate to midnight
        UTC of that date (`2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z`). If a datetime is passed,
        that exact time will be used. A `send_date` passed with no time zone
        will default to UTC, while a `send_date` passed with a time zone will be
        converted to UTC.

                  * `deliverable_unnecessary_unit` – The address is deliverable,
                  but the secondary unit information is unnecessary.

                  * `deliverable_incorrect_unit` – The address is deliverable to
                  the building's default address but the secondary unit provided
                  may not exist. There is a chance the mail will not reach the
                  intended recipient.

                  * `deliverable_missing_unit` – The address is deliverable to
                  the building's default address but is missing secondary unit
                  information. There is a chance the mail will not reach the
                  intended recipient.

                  * `undeliverable` – The address is not deliverable according
                  to the USPS.

        Verify a US or US territory address _with a live API key_. The address
        can be in components (e.g. `primary_line` is "185 Berry Street",
        `zip_code` is "94107") or as a single string (e.g. "185 Berry Street
        94107"), but not as both. Requests using a test API key validate
        required fields but return empty values unless specific `primary_line`
        values are provided.
