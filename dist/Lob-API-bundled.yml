        Lob uses RESTful HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of
        an API request. In general, 2xx indicates success, 4xx indicate an input

        A timestamp in ISO 8601 format which specifies a date after the current
        time and up to 180 days in the future to send the letter off for
        production. Setting a send date overrides the default [cancellation
        window](https://docs.lob.com/#cancellation) applied to the mailpiece.
        Until the `send_date` has passed, the mailpiece can be canceled. If a
        date in the format `2017-11-01` is passed, it will evaluate to midnight
        UTC of that date (`2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z`). If a datetime is passed,
        that exact time will be used. A `send_date` passed with no time zone
        will default to UTC, while a `send_date` passed with a time zone will be
        converted to UTC.

                USPS Certified Mail are fully tracked by USPS, therefore their
                tracking events have an additional details object with more
                detailed information about the tracking event. Some certified
                tracking event names have multiple meanings, noted in the list
                here. See the description of the details object for the full set
                of combined certified tracking event name meanings.

        `{{variable_name}}`, pass in `{"variable_name": "Harry"}` to render
        `Harry`. `merge_variables` must be an object. Any type of value is
        accepted as long as the object is valid JSON; you can use `strings`,
        `numbers`, `booleans`, `arrays`, `objects`, or `null`. The max length of
        the object is 25,000 characters. If you call `JSON.stringify` on your

                  but the secondary unit information is unnecessary.

                  * `deliverable_incorrect_unit` – The address is deliverable to
                  the building's default address but the secondary unit provided
                  may not exist. There is a chance the mail will not reach the
                  intended recipient.

                  * `deliverable_missing_unit` – The address is deliverable to
                  the building's default address but is missing secondary unit
                  information. There is a chance the mail will not reach the
                  intended recipient.

                  * `undeliverable` – The address is not deliverable according

        Verify a US or US territory address with a live API key. The address can
        be in components (e.g. `primary_line` is "185 Berry Street", `zip_code`
        is "94107") or as a single string (e.g. "185 Berry Street 94107"), but
        not as both. Requests using a test API key validate required fields but
        return empty values unless specific `primary_line` values are provided.
