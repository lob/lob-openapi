  A dictionary with a data property that contains an array of
  up to <code>limit</code> addresses. Each entry in the array is a separate
  address object. The previous and next page of address entries can be retrieved
  by calling the endpoint contained in the <code>previous_url</code> and
  <code>next_url</code> fields in the API response respectively.<br>If no
  more addresses are available beyond the current set of returned results,
  the <code>next_url</code> field will be empty.
