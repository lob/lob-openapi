  A dictionary with a data property that contains an array of
  up to `limit` addresses. Each entry in the array is a separate
  address object. The previous and next page of address entries can be retrieved
  by calling the endpoint contained in the `previous_url` and
  `next_url` fields in the API response respectively.<br>If no
  more addresses are available beyond the current set of returned results,
  the `next_url` field will be empty.
