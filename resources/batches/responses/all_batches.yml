  A dictionary with a data property that contains an array of
  up to `limit` batches. Each entry in the array is a separate
  batch. The previous and next page of batches can be retrieved
  by calling the endpoint contained in the `previous_url` and
  `next_url` fields in the API response respectively.<br>If no
  more batches are available beyond the current set of returned results,
  the `next_url` field will be empty.
