    # Add any properties that are input only that are specific to
    # this form factor here. Input only properties are properties that
    # change nature between the request media schema and the stored
    # schema. For example, addresses can be input by id, but are
    # always returned as the full object, so the 'to' and 'from'
    # addresses are included above in the editable schema.
