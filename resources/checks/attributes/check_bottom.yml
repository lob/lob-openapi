description: >-
  The artwork to use on the bottom of the check page. Accepts an HTML
  string of under 10,000 characters, the ID of a saved [HTML
  template](https://lob.github.io/lob-openapi/#tag/Templates), or a
  remote URL or a local upload of an HTML, PDF, PNG, or JPG file. Remote
  URLs have a 20 MB file size limit and must be downloaded within 40
  seconds. HTML files passed as remote URLs or local file uploads have
  no character limit. HTML merge variables should not include delimiting
  whitespace. PDF, PNG, and JPGs must be sized at 8.5"x11" at 300 DPI,
  while supplied HTML will be rendered and trimmed to fit on a 8.5"x11"
  page. The check bottom will always be printed in black & white. Must
  conform to [this
  template](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public.lob.com/assets/templates/check_bottom_template.pdf).
