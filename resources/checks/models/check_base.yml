          An integer that designates the check number.

          If `check_number` is not provided, checks created from a new
          `bank_account` will start at `10000` and increment with each check
          created with the `bank_account`.

          A provided `check_number` overrides the defaults. Subsequent checks
          created with the same `bank_account` will increment from the provided
          check number.
