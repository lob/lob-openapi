          A document to include with the check. Accepts an HTML string of under
          10,000 characters, the ID of a saved [HTML template](https://lob.github.io/lob-openapi/#tag/Templates), or a remote URL or
          a local upload of an HTML, PDF, PNG, or JPG file. Remote URLs have a
          20 MB file size limit and must be downloaded within 40 seconds. HTML
          files passed as remote URLs or local file uploads have no character
          limit. HTML merge variables should not include delimiting
          whitespace. All pages of PDF, PNG, and JPGs must be sized at 8.5"x11"
          at 300 DPI, while supplied HTML will be rendered and trimmed to as
          many 8.5"x11" pages as necessary. If a PDF is provided, it must be 6
          pages or fewer. The attachment will be printed double-sided in black &
          white and will be included in the envelope after the check
          page. Please follow these [design guidelines](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public.lob.com/assets/templates/check_attachment_template.pdf).
