      Must either be an address ID or an inline object with correct address
      parameters. Checks cannot be sent internationally (`address_country` must be
      `US`). The total string of the sum of `address_line1` and `address_line2` must
      be no longer than 50 characters combined. If an object is used, an address
      will be created, corrected, and standardized for free whenever possible
      using our US Address Verification engine, and returned back with an
      ID. Depending on your [Print & Mail Edition](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/editions),
      addresses may also be run through [National Change of Address (NCOA)](https://lob.com/docs#ncoa).
      If an address used does not meet your accountâ€™s
      [US Mail Strictness Setting]()https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/account, the request will
      fail. [More about verification of mailing addresses](https://www.lob.com/guides#mailing_addresses)
