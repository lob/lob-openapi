          If setting a campaign to `pending_approval` the Informed Delivery campaign will not be active, and you can not send mail using it.
          It will be editable in this status however, and changes can be made until `approved`.
          **NOTE** that the default status is `approved` which makes the campaign active, but un-editable.
