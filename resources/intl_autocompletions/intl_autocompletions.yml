  summary: Autocomplete

  description: >-
    Given an address prefix consisting of a partial primary line and country, as well as
    optional input of city, state, and zip code, this functionality returns up
    to 10 full International address suggestions. Not all of them will turn out to be valid
    addresses; they'll need to be [verified](#operation/intl_verification).
