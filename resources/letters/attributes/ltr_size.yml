enum:
  - us_letter

description: >
  Specifies the size of the letter. It accepts two values `us_letter` and `us_legal`.
  If the [Lob-Version header](#tag/Versioning-and-Changelog) in the request is set to `2024-01-01` and above,
  the `size` property is automatically included with the default value of `us_letter`,
  unless explicitly specified.


  Please note that attempting to include the `size` property in the request with the `Lob-Version` header
  predating to `2024-01-01` will result in an error.
