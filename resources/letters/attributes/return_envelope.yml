description: >-
  Indicates if a return envelope is requested for the letter.
  The value corresponding to this field is by default a boolean.
  But if the account is signed up for custom return envelopes,
  the value is of type string and is `no_9_single_window` for
  a standard return envelope and a custom `return_envelope_id`
  for non-standard return envelopes.


  To include a return envelope with your letter, set to `true` and specify
  the `perforated_page`. See

  incurred.
