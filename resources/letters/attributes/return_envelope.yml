    Indicates if a return envelope is requested for the letter.
    The value corresponding to this field is by default a boolean.
    But if the account is signed up for custom return envelopes,
    the value is of type string and is `no_9_single_window` for
    a standard return envelope and a custom `return_envelope_id`
    for non-standard return envelopes.


    To include a return envelope with your letter, set to `true` and specify
    the `perforated_page`. See
    <a href="https://www.lob.com/pricing/print-mail#compare" target="_blank">pricing</a> for extra costs
    incurred.
