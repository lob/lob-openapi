      Must either be an address ID or an inline object with correct address
      parameters. If an object is used, an address will be created, corrected,
      and standardized for free whenever possible using our US Address
      Verification engine (if it is a US address), and returned back with an
      ID. Depending on your [Print & Mail Edition](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/editions),
      US addresses may also be run
      through [National Change of Address (NCOA)](https://lob.com/docs#ncoa). Non-US addresses
      will be standardized into uppercase only. If a US address used does not
      meet your accountâ€™s [US Mail strictness setting](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/account),
      the request will fail. Read more here.
