          Indicates if a return envelope is requested for the letter.
          The value corresponding to this field is by default a boolean.
          But if the account is signed up for custom return envelopes,
          the value is of type string and is `no_9_single_window` for
          a standard return envelope and a custom `return_envelope_id`
          for non-standard return envelopes.


          To include a return envelope with your letter, set to `true` and specify
          the `perforated_page`. See
          <a href="https://www.lob.com/pricing/print-mail#compare" target="_blank">pricing</a> for extra costs

          perforated for use with the return envelope. Must be greater than or equal
          to `1`. The blank page added by `address_placement=insert_blank_page` will be
          ignored when considering the perforated page number. To see how
          perforation will impact your letter design, view our <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public.lob.com/assets/templates/letter_perf_template.pdf" target="_blank">perforation guide</a>.

          Accepts an envelope ID for any customized envelope with available

          will not be sent, and an error will be returned. If the letter has more
          than 6 sheets, it will be sent in a blank flat envelope. Custom envelopes
          may be created and ordered from the dashboard. This feature is exclusive
