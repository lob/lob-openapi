          Accepts an HTML string of under 10,000 characters, the ID of a saved HTML
          template, or a remote URL or a local upload of an HTML or PDF file. Remote
          URLs have a 20 MB file size limit and must be downloaded within 40
          seconds. HTML files passed as remote URLs or local file upload have no
          character limit. HTML merge variables should not include delimiting
          whitespace. All pages of a supplied PDF file must be sized at 8.5"x11",
          while supplied HTML will be rendered and trimmed to as many 8.5"x11" pages
          as necessary. For design specifications, please see our [PDF](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public.lob.com/assets/templates/letter_template.pdf)
          and [HTML](https://docs.lob.com/#html-examples)
          templates. If a `custom_envelope` is used, follow [this template](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public.lob.com/assets/templates/letter_custom_envelope.pdf). For
          domestic destinations, the file limit is 60 pages single-sided or 120
          pages double-sided. For international destinations, the file limit is 6
          pages single-sided or 12 pages double-sided. PDFs that surpass the file
          limit will error, while HTML that renders more pages than the file limit
          will be trimmed. See [pricing](https://lob.com/pricing/print-mail#compare) for extra costs incurred. Any letters over 6
          pages single-sided or 12 pages double-sided will be placed in a
          [flat envelope](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public.lob.com/assets/templates/letter_flat_template.pdf) instead of the standard double window envelope.
