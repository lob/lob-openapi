          Accepts an envelope ID for any customized envelope with available
          inventory. If no inventory is available for the specified ID, the letter

          than 6 sheets, it will be sent in a blank flat envelope. Custom envelopes
          may be created and ordered from the dashboard. This feature is exclusive
          to certain customers. Upgrade to the appropriate Print & Mail Edition to
