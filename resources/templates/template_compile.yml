        For advanced legacy templates:
        - strict: Lob will send a `422` error if you define a merge variable in your HTML that is not passed in the `merge_variables` field of that request. Pass `''` or `null` to have a particular defined variable not render.
        - relaxed: Lob will not send an error if you define a merge variable in your HTML that is not included in the `merge_variables` field of that request. Instead, we will simply render nothing in the HTML in place of that merge variable.
