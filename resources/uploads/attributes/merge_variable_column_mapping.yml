title: Merge Variable Mapping
type: object
nullable: true
default: null
example:
  name: recipient_name
  gift_code: code
  qr_code_redirect_url: redirect_url
description: The mapping of column headers in your file to the merge variables present in your creative. See our <a href="https://help.lob.com/print-and-mail/building-a-mail-strategy/campaign-or-triggered-sends/campaign-audience-guide#step-3-map-merge-variable-data-if-applicable-7" target="_blank">Campaign Audience Guide</a> for additional details. <br />If a merge variable has the same "name" as a "key" in the `requiredAddressColumnMapping` or `optionalAddressColumnMapping` objects, then they **CANNOT** have a different value in this object. If a different value is provided, then when the campaign is processing it will get overwritten with the mapped value present in the `requiredAddressColumnMapping` or `optionalAddressColumnMapping` objects. The redirect URLs for QR codes can also be customized using this mapping. If the URL has a variable and the variable mapping existsing here, then data from the respective column in the audience file will be merged into the URL template.
