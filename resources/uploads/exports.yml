    Campaign Exports can help you understand exactly which records in a campaign could not be created. By initiating and retrieving an export, you will get row-by-row errors for your campaign. For a step-by-step walkthrough of creating a campaign and exporting failures, see our [Campaigns Guide](https://help.lob.com/best-practices/launching-your-first-campaign).
