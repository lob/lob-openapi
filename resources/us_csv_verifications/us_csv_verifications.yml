  summary: CSV Verify

  description: >-
    Verify a CSV of US or US territory addresses _with a live
    API key_. A completed CSV will be emailed
    to your account once the cleansing and verification process is finished. It's reccomended that your CSV
    file is under 250k lines. The endpoint requires a `csv_file` and the index of your column headers. The columns
    should be 1-indexed 
    For example if you have a CSV with address primary lines in the first column and all postal codes in the 5th column,
    pass in `primary_line_mapping` as 1 and `postal_code_mapping` as 5.
