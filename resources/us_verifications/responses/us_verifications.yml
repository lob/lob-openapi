            Summarizes the deliverability of the `us_verification` object.
            For full details, see the `deliverability_analysis` field. Possible values are:
            * `deliverable` – The address is deliverable by the USPS.
            * `deliverable_unnecessary_unit` – The address is deliverable, but the secondary unit information is unnecessary.
            * `deliverable_incorrect_unit` – The address is deliverable to the building's default address but the secondary unit provided may not exist. There is a chance the mail will not reach the intended recipient.
            * `deliverable_missing_unit` – The address is deliverable to the building's default address but is missing secondary unit information. There is a chance the mail will not reach the intended recipient.
            * `undeliverable` – The address is not deliverable according to the USPS.
