  summary: Verify a US or US territory address with a live API key.

  description: >-
    Verify a US or US territory address with a live API key. The
    address can be in components (e.g. <code>primary_line</code> is
    "185 Berry Street", <code>zip_code</code> is "94107") or as a
    single string (e.g. "185 Berry Street 94107"), but not as both.
    Requests using a test API key validate required fields but
    return empty values unless specific <code>primary_line</code>
    values are provided.
