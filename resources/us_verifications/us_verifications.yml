  summary: Verify

  description: >-
    Verify a US or US territory address _with a live API key_. The
    address can be in components (e.g. `primary_line` is
    "185 Berry Street", `zip_code` is "94107") or as a
    single string (e.g. "185 Berry Street 94107"), but not as both.
    Requests using a test API key validate required fields but
    return empty values unless specific `primary_line`
    values are provided.

        `urbanization`, and `last_line`. Default casing is `upper`.
