description: Customize and place a QR code on all the postcards, letters or self mailers in a campaign. Redirect URLs are fully customizable i.e. they can be standard single URLs for the whole campaign, or variables can be used to customize them for each recipient. More details on customizing redirect URLs can be found in <a href="https://help.lob.com/print-and-mail/designing-mail-creatives/adding-qr-codes#destination-url-and-redirects" target="_blank">our help center.</a>

    description: Sets how a QR code is being positioned in the document. Together with this, you should provide one of 'top' or 'bottom', and one of 'left' or 'right'.

  top:
    type: string
    description: Vertical distance (in inches) to place QR code from the top. Only allowed if "bottom" isn't provided.

  right:
    type: string
    description: Horizontal distance (in inches) to place QR code from the right. Only allowed if "left" isn't provided.

  left:
    type: string
    description: Horizontal distance (in inches) to place QR code from the left. Only allowed if "right" isn't provided.

  bottom:
    type: string
    description: Vertical distance (in inches) to place QR code from the bottom. Only allowed if "top" isn't provided.

  redirect_url:
    description: |
      The url to redirect the user when a QR code is scanned. The URL can be a standard URL for all recipients in the campaign or customized per recipient. To customize for each recipient, use a mustache style template with merge variables enclosed in curly braces(for example, `https://www.example.com` or `{{name}}` or `https://www.example.com?q={{name}}`). If a merge variable is used in the URL, a mapping to that merge variable should be provided in the `mergeVariableColumnMapping` property when creating an upload. If the variable is not provided/does not exist, then the templated URL will be used. More details on customizing redirect URLs can be found in <a href="https://help.lob.com/print-and-mail/designing-mail-creatives/adding-qr-codes#destination-url-and-redirects" target="_blank">our help center.</a>.
      Note: Please use unique variable names between HTML templates and Redirect URLs to avoid conflicts. For example, if you are using `{{name}}` in the HTML template, use `{{name_redirect}}` in the Redirect URL. They can still be mapped to the same column in the audience file. Failing to set or map the redirect URL when using QR codes may lead to errors in generating mail pieces.

  width:
    type: string
    description: The size (in inches) of the QR code with a minimum of 1 inch. All QR codes are generated as a square.

  pages:
    type: string
    description: Specify the pages where the QR code should be stamped in a comma separated format. Your QR code can be printed in the same position on multiple pages. For postcards, the values should either be "front", "back" (for either front or back) or "front,back" (for the QR code to be printed on both sides). For self-mailers, the values should either be "inside", "outside" (for either inside or outside) or "inside,outside" (for the QR code to be printed on both sides). For letters, the values can be specific page numbers ("1", "3"), page number ranges such as "1-3", or a comma separated combination of both ("1,3,5-7").
