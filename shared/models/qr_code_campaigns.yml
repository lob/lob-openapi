      Redirect all mail receipients to either a single URL or a custom personalized URL for each address. 
      To redirect to a single URL for the whole campaign, add a `redirect_url` in the request body along with the url as string.
      To redirect to a custom URL for each address, create an extra column in the [audience file](https://help.lob.com/print-and-mail/building-a-mail-strategy/campaign-or-triggered-sends/campaign-audience-guide) with a unique link against each address row and map that row using the merge variable mapping while creating an upload.
      If the QR code section is used but a redirection url is not provided or mapped while creating an upload, then there might be failures in creating individual mail pieces.
