    description: Sets how a QR code is being positioned in the document. Together with this, you should provide one of 'top' or 'bottom', and one of 'left' or 'right'.

  top:
    type: string
    description: Vertical distance (in inches) to place QR code from the top. Only allowed if "bottom" isn't provided.

  right:
    type: string
    description: Horizonal distance (in inches) to place QR code from the right. Only allowed if "left" isn't provided.

  left:
    type: string
    description: Horizonal distance (in inches) to place QR code from the left. Only allowed if "right" isn't provided.

  bottom:
    type: string
    description: Vertical distance (in inches) to place QR code from the bottom. Only allowed if "top" isn't provided.

  redirect_url:
    description: >
      Redirect all mail receipients to either a single URL or a custom personalized URL for each address. 
      To redirect to a single URL for the whole campaign, add a `redirect_url` in the request body along with the url as string.
      To redirect to a custom URL for each address, do not provide any value for `redirect_url`. Instead, create an extra column in the [audience file](https://help.lob.com/print-and-mail/building-a-mail-strategy/campaign-or-triggered-sends/campaign-audience-guide) with a unique link against each address row and while creating an upload, map `qr_code_redirect_url` to this column.
      If the QR code section is used but a redirection url is not provided or mapped while creating an upload, then there might be failures in creating individual mail pieces.

  width:
    type: string
    description: The size (in inches) of the QR code with a minimum of 1 inch. All QR codes are generated as a square.

  pages:
    type: string
    description: Specify the pages where the QR code should be stamped in a comma separated format. Your QR code can be printed in the same position on multiple pages. For postcards, the values should either be "front", "back" (for either front or back) or "front,back" (for the QR code to be printed on both sides). For self-mailers, the values should either be "inside", "outside" (for either inside or outside) or "inside,outside" (for the QR code to be printed on both sides). For letters, the values can be specific page numbers ("1", "3"), page number ranges such as "1-3", or a comma separated combination of both ("1,3,5-7").
