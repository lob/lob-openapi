      Redirect all mail recipients to either a single URL or specify a unique URL for each recipient.
      To redirect all mail recipients in a campaign to the same URL, assign the desired URL to this field.
      To redirect each mail recipient to a unique URL, leave this field empty and specify the redirect link for each row in the audience file. Then, when creating a new upload, map this column to the `qr_code_redirect_url` key in the `mergeVariableColumnMapping` property. 

      Note: Failing to set or map the redirect URL when using QR codes may lead to errors in generating mail pieces.
