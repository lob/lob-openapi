  A string designating the mail postage type:
  * `usps_first_class` - (default)
  * `usps_standard` - a [cheaper option](https://lob.com/pricing/print-mail#compare) which is
  less predictable and takes longer to deliver. `usps_standard` cannot be used with `4x6`
  postcards or for any postcards sent outside of the United States.
