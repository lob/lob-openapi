          Name of tracking event (for normal postcards, self mailers, letters, and checks):

            * `Mailed` - The mailpiece has been handed off to and accepted by USPS
              and is en route. <a href="https://help.lob.com/print-and-mail/getting-data-and-results/tracking-your-mail#mailed-tracking-events-4" target="_blank">More about

            * `In Transit` - The mailpiece is being processed at the entry/origin facility.

            * `In Local Area` - The mailpiece is being processed at the destination facility.

            * `Processed for Delivery` - The mailpiece has been greenlit for
              delivery at the recipient's nearest postal facility. The mailpiece
              should reach the mailbox within 1 business day of this tracking
              event.

            * `Delivered` - The mail piece has been delivered to 
              the recipientâ€™s address. The final scan is generated when the mail 
              carrier's GPS unit leaves the delivery area.

            * `Re-Routed` - The mailpiece is re-routed due to recipient change of
              address, address errors, or USPS relabeling of barcode/ID tag
              area.

            * `Returned to Sender` - The mailpiece is being returned to sender due
              to barcode, ID tag area, or address errors.
            
            * `International Exit` - The mail piece has been processed to 
              ship to a destination abroad. This is typically the last 
              scan a US-originated international mail piece will receive 
              from the USPS.
